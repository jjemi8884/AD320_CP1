      <p>
        My name is Justin Jemison and my wife and I have a small hobby farm
        located in southern King county. We bought the farm in 2017 while I was
        serving in the United States Coast Guard onboard
        <em>USCGC Polar Star</em>. Over the course of my service on the
        <em>USCGC Polar Star</em> and while stationed at Base Seattle, our
        little farm has grown in oppupancy with many feathered friends. While
        maintianin this small slice of heaven, both my wife and I are returning
        to higher education to advance our careers. She is striving to be a
        Surgical Technician while I am focued on Computer Science.
